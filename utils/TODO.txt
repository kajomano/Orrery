Major TODOs ====================================================================
* HBV
  * Rays could contain the ray_ids
  * Better building alg: improve on it from papers/blogs:
    * Large objects should be split into their own (surface)
    * Faster building

* Multi-threaded gpu calls for full utilization
* Tiled rendering

* Try compiling an executable for speedup
  * TorchScript

* Movable camera

* Better HDR color saturation
* Glow post-processing effect

* Progress bar

* Textured spheres
* Other geometrical shapes -=> proper orrery
* Volumes - subsurface scattering and fog
* Black holes
* Support for heightmapped surfaces with raymarching
* Denoiser
* Moving objects

Constant TODOs =================================================================
* Save nice images as developement progresses
* Merge with master sometimes
* Check performance with snakeviz and try to speed up
